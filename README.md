# To Do App  

This project is my attempt at making a to-do list app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with object-oriented programming techniques to create a flexible to-list that saves to the browser's local storage.  

## Design Brief  

- Each task is a JS object with the following properties   
  - Title  
  - Description  
  - Due Date  
  - Done  
- Each task is stored in a taskList array and saved to local storage  
- Each task is displayed on the frontend as a separate card  
- There is a form which creates new tasks and transforms to show additional form elements on focus  
- I can mark each task done and delete each task from the list and local storage  
- I can filter tasks based on tags, done status, and due date  
- I can toggle between multiple themes
